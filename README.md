# ioa-julia-tutorials

An introductory Julia tutorial for the Institute of Astronomy (IoA), University of Cambridge. Consists of:

* an introductory slideshow Welcome to Julia, covering what Julia is, what makes it different from other programming languages, and how you can use it (including how to access it on the IoA cluster);
* an extended tutorial, targeted at astronomers who have knowledge of other languages like Python, IDL, or Matlab, which covers syntax and useful language features; and
* three exercises intended to be done interactively. These are
  - [Exercise 1](exercise-1-julia-python.ipynb): how to farm work out to Python when you don't want to or don't know how to write something in Julia,
  - [Exercise 2](exercise-2-FITS.ipynb): comparing the use of Python and FITSIO to read and write FITS files, and
  - [Exercise 3](exercise-3-types.ipynb): using types to write an N-body integrator in 80 lines.

These tutorials use the [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) so you can download and run them, or view them online in github or using [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/swt30/ioa-julia-tutorials/tree/master/). They were written using Julia 0.3.6.
